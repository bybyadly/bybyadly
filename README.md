- Currently focused on developing an **AI-powered tool** that revolutionizes the way we analyze tea production, making agriculture smarter and more efficient. My work merges technology with tradition, using the power of data to optimize age-old processes.

- Deep in the world of **machine learning and predictive analytics**, I'm constantly exploring new methods to harness big data, transforming it into actionable insights for **sustainable farming** practices. The ultimate goal? To balance innovation with environmental responsibility.

- Much like the art of tea-making, I approach problem-solving with a mindset of balance and patience. Every data point is a leaf, and together, they brew the perfect solution. **Chinese tea culture** teaches us harmony, and that’s exactly what I bring to every project.
